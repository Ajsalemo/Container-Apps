# Container App sample applications and ARM templates
We have a few sample applications and ARM templates that you can try out for scenarios in Container Apps. The applications have been containerized and published to a public Docker repository. So you can deploy the ARM templates as-is, or download this GitHub repository and modify the applications and ARM templates to suit other testing purposes.
We have additional applications and ARM templates that are tailored to the different Dapr scenarios that can be used in Container Apps, which will be uploaded soon.
